# Installation - PolyMC


Installing the modpack through PolyMC is *extremely* simple. All one has to do is follow the simple steps below and you'll be off to the races!

NOTE: This installation assumes that you are using Windows to install. Installation on Mac is just as easy and should be extremely similar

## Step 1 - Download
First, download the PolyMC launcher for your respective operating system from [here](https://polymc.org/download/).

After the file is done downloading, install as you would any other program and configure how you'd like. Open after the installation is complete.

## Step 2 - Signing In
Once you have the launcher installed and opened, you will be greeted by the opening screen, which itself contains an element named "Profiles" next to a Steve head. Click the icon.

## Step 3 - Adding Modpack

Now that you are signed in, navigate to the [Releases page](https://github.com/sylvrs/electric-cowboy/releases) and look for the first file link named something like `electric-cowboy-v[VERSION].zip`. From there, save the file and navigate back to PolyMC.

Once back on the main screen of PolyMC, click the "Add Instance" button followed by the "Import from zip" option on the "New Instance" menu.

From there, click browse, change the file input type from `.zip` to `.mrpack` in the bottom right of the file explorer, locate your file, and click "Open".

## Step 4 - Opening Instance
Now that your instance is installed, open the modpack by double clicking its name.
